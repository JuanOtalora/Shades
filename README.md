# Project Overview
<p align="justify">
Basic 2D platformer where you control both yourself and your shade to accomplish puzzles. The idea is that you have to manege both yourself and your shade to manage intrinsic puzzles that challenge you to think on how to avoid perilous traps and use two different set of abilities to reach the final goal. This project counts as a college thesis, a more practical view on the development of new basic mechanics that can shake the videogame development industry. To make matters possible there was team assigned to the project to work on parallel tasks to finish the project. Between them was the overall structure of levels and the design of new and ingenious mechanics. The team consisted of two students under the guidance of one professor. This is to make sure the work is divided and there is a form of authority in charge of guiding the development of the project. With this there was a structure on the way the game was developed and, for this reason, the project works as an organized software engineering activity. With this in mind there were more than just casual planning for the final game. As an structured project, the game ended up being called...

The project was created using the technologies of Unity with minor scripting on C# Language. The game, as stated before, follows the adventure of a single character that needs to get into the end of each level and collect a single gem to progress onwards the next level. This kind of narrative lacks in story but is not necessary a bad thing when the main goal is to focus on the mechanics. Little story but more direct light for the main advantage of the game.

Talking about the mechanics of the game, there needs to be some explanation for them. They are innovative in the way there is a reflection of the main chracter that the player can control and with that puzzles are build around it. In a more detailed way, the player can alternate between the main player and its shade to traverse the different worlds. These worlds are riddled with challenges thata require thea bility of both the main character and the reflection.

This puzzles range from wide variety of mental works, but are mostly inspired in doing two things in order to progress. This is what is called the meain mechanic of the game. So for example, in a situation where the player gets stuck because it cannot reach a high place, the player may get the understanding that by using the shade it could move certain objects that could be used as vantage point to get up and jump. These are the kind of things that might be included in the game to make it more challenging.
