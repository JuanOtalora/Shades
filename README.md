# Shades
Basic 2D platformer where you control both yourself and your shade to accomplish puzzles. The idea is that you have to manege both yourself and your shade to manage intrinsic puzzles that challenge you to think on how to avoid perilous traps and use two different set of abilities to reach the final goal. This project counts as a college thesis, a more practical view on the development of new basic mechanics that can shake the videogame development industry.
