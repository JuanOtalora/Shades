<p align="justify">
Basic 2D platformer where you control both yourself and your shade to accomplish puzzles. The idea is that you have to manege both yourself and your shade to manage intrinsic puzzles that challenge you to think on how to avoid perilous traps and use two different set of abilities to reach the final goal. This project counts as a college thesis, a more practical view on the development of new basic mechanics that can shake the videogame development industry. To make matters possible there was team assigned to the project to work on parallel tasks to finish the project. Between them was the overall structure of levels and the design of new and ingenious mechanics. The team consisted of two students under the guidance of one professor. This is to make sure the work is divided and there is a form of authority in charge of guiding the development of the project. With this there was a structure on the way the game was developed and, for this reason, the project works as an organized software engineering activity. With this in mind there were more than just casual planning for the final game. As an structured project the game ended up being called...
